# Conformance Constraints Synthesizer

This repo contains source code for synthesizing conformance 
constraints (a.k.a. `data invariants` and `data assertions`) from the 
paper
[Conformance Constraint Discovery:
Measuring Trust in Data-Driven Systems](https://afariha.github.io/papers/Conformance_Constraints_SIGMOD_2021.pdf) (SIGMOD 2021 talk [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS2xyRNww9w)). The full technical report is in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01289).

The repo also contains source code related to the demonstration papers [ExTuNe: Explaining Tuple Non-conformance](https://afariha.github.io/papers/ExTuNe_SIGMOD_2020_demo.pdf) (SIGMOD 2020 talk [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYzGDgQ1itE))
and [CoCo: Interactive Exploration of Conformance Constraints for Data Understanding and Data Cleaning](https://afariha.github.io/papers/CoCo_SIGMOD_2021_Demo.pdf) (SIGMOD 2021 talk [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6xFKR4Y99c)).
